classdef sceneEye < hiddenHandle
% Create a sceneEye object
%
% Syntax:
%   myScene = sceneEye();
%
% Description:
%    sceneEye contains the information needed to construct a new PBRT
%    file that we can then render to get a retinal image.
%
%    sceneEye is analogous to the "scene" structure in ISETBIO (and
%    ISET), and it will support similar commands. Unlike the
%    ISET/ISETBIO "scene", as for new entities we created it as a
%    MATLAB class.
%
%    This code is starting out in service of the eyeModel. We may
%    extend to replace the scene structure (some day).
%
% Notes:
%    * TODO - Implement the check that BW describes below. Is there a way
%      to check inputs? For example, eyePos is not a dependent variable,
%      but is instead read in from the PBRT file. However, say the user
%      wants to change the value in their script so they write:
%           myScene = sceneEye('pbrtFile', xxx);
%           myScene.eyePos = [x y z];
%      Is there a way to ensure they put in a 3x1 vector for eyePos, other
%      than just rigourous error checking in the code?
%	 * [Note: BW - (Reference first TODO) Yes, I think so, using the
%	   myScene.set('eyePos', val) approach, or perhaps myScene.set.eyePos =
%	   val. In these cases the set operation can pass through an input
%	   parser that validates the input value (I think).]
%    * [Note: BW - maxDepth & nWaveBands are often empty, so let's perform
%      the checks below. However, I should find a more permanant solution
%      to cases like these. (See the note above). Maybe in
%      piGetRenderRecipe we should put in the default values if any of
%      these rendering options are missing (e.g. if Renderer is missing,
%      put in Renderer 'sampler'.)]
%    * [Note: XXX - (from constructor) What happens if the recipe doesn't
%      include any of the following, or any of the subfields we call?]
%    * TODO - Determine a better way to infer the accommodation. Currently
%      we assume the naming conventions is "%s_%f.dat" This is not
%      foolproof, so maybe we can think of a more robust way to do this in
%      the future?
%    * [Note: TL - What does this hiddenHandle mean? I seem to need it to
%      avoid errors.]
%    * TODO - Fix example!

properties (GetAccess=public, SetAccess=public)
    % name - The name of the render
    name;
    
    % modelname - The name of the schematic eye used to render the scene.
    %   Depending on the model chosen, some other options may not be
    %   applicable. Currently possible models include: navarro (default)
    %   gullstrand-le grand, and arizona eye model.
    modelName;
    
    % resolution - resolution of render (pixels)
    %   Instead of rows/cols we use a general resolution variable. This
    %   is because the eye model can only take equal rows and columns
    %   and the rendered image is always square.
    resolution;

    % fov - Field of view of the render in degrees
    %   This value is calculated from the retina distance and the
    %   retina size. This is only a close approximation since the
    %   retina is very slightly curved.
    fov;

    % accommodation - Diopters of accommodation for 550 nm light
    %   We change the properties of the lens to match the desired
    %   accommodation. For example, if we set this to 5 diopters, 550
    %   nm rays from 0.2 meters will be in focus on the retina.
    accommodation;

    % eccentricity - Horizontal and vertical angles on the retina
    %   corresponding to the center of the rendered image. Positive angles
    %   are to the right/up (from the eye's point of view) and negative
    %   angles are to the left/down. For example, an image with [0 0]
    %   eccentricity is centered on the center of the retina. An image with
    %   [30 0] eccentricity is centered 30 degrees to the right of the
    %   center of the retina.
    eccentricity;

    % pupilDiameter - Diameter of the pupil (mm)
    pupilDiameter;

    %retinaRadius - The curvature of the retina in mm
    %   If one imagines the retina as asection of a sphere, this radius
    %   value determines the distance from the edge of the sphere to
    %   its center. We will not change this most of the time, but
    %   sometimes it is helpful to make the retina very flat in order
    %   to measure certain properties of the eye.
    retinaRadius;

    % retinaDistance - Distance between the back lens and the retina
    %   We will not change this most of the time, but sometimes it is
    %   helpful to move the retina back and forth, like a camera
    %   sensor, to see things affects like chromatic aberration.
    retinaDistance;

    % numRays - Number of rays to shoot per pixel.
    %   This determines the quality of the render and affects the time
    %   spent rendering. This should be a factor of 2. Low quality is
    %   typically 64 or256 rays, high quality is typically 2048 or 4096
    %   rays.
    numRays;

    % numBounces - Number of bounces before ray terminates
    %   This also determines how accurately light is modeled in the
    %   rendering. The amount needed is highly scene dependent.
    %   Typically set to 1 for simple, diffuse scenes. A high value
    %   would be 4-8 for scenes with lots of reflections, caustics, or
    %   glassy materials.
    numBounces;

    % numCABands - Number of wavelength samples to take when modeling CA
    %   We shoot extra rays of different wavelengths in order to model
    %   chromatic aberration through the lens system. This determines
    %   the number of samples we take. For example, if we set this to 4
    %   we shoot rays at...
    numCABands;

    % eyePos - Position of the eye within the scene in [x y z] format
    %   [x y z]
    eyePos;

    % eyeTo - Point where the eye is looking at
    %   [x y z], the difference between eyeTo and eyePos is the
    %   direction vector that the optical axis is aligned with.
    eyeTo;

    % eyeUp - Up vector used when building the LookAt transform
    %   [x y z], this is typically [0 0 1] but it depends on how the
    %   eye is oriented. For example, if this was [0 0 -1] the eye
    %   would be "upside down." Some values are not valid, for example
    %   if the eye is looking down the z-axis (eyePos = [0 0 0], eyeTo
    %   = [0 0 1]) then the up vector cannot be [0 0 1].
    eyeUp;
    
    % diffractionEnabled Toggle diffraction. When it diffraction simulation
    %   is enabled, PBRT will use HURB to simulate the effect of
    %   diffraction. May cause slow-downs. 
    diffractionEnabled;
    
    %DEBUGMODE Toggle debug mode.
    %   For debug mode we switch to a perspective camera with the same
    %   FOV as the eye. This can be potentially faster and easier to
    %   render than going through the eye.
    debugMode;
